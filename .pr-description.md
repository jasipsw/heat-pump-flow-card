## Summary

This PR includes multiple improvements to the heat pump flow card, bumping the version to 0.20.1:

- ✅ **G2 valve size and alignment fixes** - Reduced scale and adjusted positioning to align with DHW supply
- ✅ **G2 valve animations** - Added smooth transitions and pulsing effects when valve switches modes
- ✅ **Flow dot stroke opacity control** - New `dot_stroke_opacity` configuration option (default 0.8)
- ✅ **DHW coil visual feedback** - Coil turns gray when no flow (heating mode)
- ✅ **Auxiliary heater visualization** - Spiral coil with intensity-based glow effect based on power consumption
- ✅ **Configurable aux heater display name** - Generic `aux_heater` configuration with customizable `display_name`
- ✅ **Brand name display fix** - Fixed positioning to prevent clipping
- ✅ **Debug logging removed** - Cleaned up excessive console logging

## Configuration Changes

### New: Auxiliary Heater Configuration

```yaml
aux_heater:
  enabled: true                          # Show auxiliary heater visualization
  power_entity: sensor.aux_heater_power  # Power consumption sensor (W)
  max_power: 18000                       # Maximum power for normalization (18kW)
  display_name: "V18"                    # Display name (e.g., "V18", "V24", "AUX")
```

### Enhanced: Flow Dot Stroke Control

```yaml
animation:
  dot_stroke_width: 1.0      # Reduced from 1.5
  dot_stroke_opacity: 0.8    # New: control stroke opacity (0-1)
```

### Heat Pump Display Name

```yaml
heat_pump:
  display_name: "Chiltrix CX50-2"  # Shows brand/model at top of heat pump
```

## Visual Improvements

1. **G2 Valve**:
   - Reduced from scale 1.4 to 1.0
   - Adjusted positioning to align outflow with DHW supply pipe
   - Added CSS animations with smooth transitions
   - Pulsing effect when active (DHW mode)

2. **Auxiliary Heater**:
   - Spiral coil visualization wraps around HP-to-G2 pipe
   - Intensity-based glow effect (0-100% power)
   - Dynamic stroke width and shadow based on power consumption
   - Power display label showing kW consumption

3. **DHW Coil**:
   - Gray color with low opacity during heating mode (no flow)
   - Hot color with high opacity during DHW mode (active flow)

4. **Flow Dots**:
   - Configurable stroke opacity for better customization
   - Reduced default stroke width for less prominent outline

## Test Configuration

Added `examples/test-configuration.yaml` with input helpers for testing all features including:
- Aux heater power testing (0W, 4.5kW, 9kW, 13.5kW, 18kW)
- G2 valve mode switching
- All sensor inputs

## Breaking Changes

None - all new features are optional and use sensible defaults.

## Migration Notes

If you were using the experimental `v18_heater` configuration, rename it to `aux_heater` and use the new `display_name` field:

```yaml
# Old (experimental):
v18_heater:
  enabled: true
  power_entity: sensor.v18_power

# New:
aux_heater:
  enabled: true
  power_entity: sensor.v18_power
  display_name: "V18"
```

## Files Changed

- `src/heat-pump-flow-card.ts` - Main implementation
- `src/types.ts` - Type definitions
- `src/styles.ts` - CSS animations
- `src/const.ts` - Version bump
- `package.json` - Version bump
- `examples/cx50-configuration.yaml` - Updated examples
- `examples/test-configuration.yaml` - New test configuration

## Test Plan

- [ ] Verify G2 valve alignment with DHW supply pipe
- [ ] Test G2 valve animation when switching between heating/DHW modes
- [ ] Verify aux heater visualization at different power levels (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- [ ] Check DHW coil turns gray when G2 valve is in heating mode
- [ ] Verify brand name displays correctly on heat pump
- [ ] Test flow dot stroke opacity configuration
- [ ] Verify no excessive console logging
