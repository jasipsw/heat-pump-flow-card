# Claude Code Session Notes

## Build Process
- **DO NOT run `npm run build` except for syntax checking**
- The build runs automatically on GitHub when changes are pushed and merged
- **DO NOT push build products to GitHub** - they are generated by CI/CD
- The `dist/` directory is auto-generated and should not be committed

## Development Workflow
1. Make changes to source files in `src/`
2. Optionally run `npm run build` ONLY to verify syntax/compilation
3. Push source changes to GitHub
4. Build artifacts are generated automatically by GitHub Actions
