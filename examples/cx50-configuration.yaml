# Notes for CX50 System:

# Flow Sensors:
# - sensor.cx50_pump_flow_lpm: Primary loop (HP → Buffer) ~3 L/min idle, higher when running
# - sensor.hydronic_flow_flow_rate: Secondary loop (Buffer → Radiant Floor) ~35.5 L/min constant
#
# These flow rates are DIFFERENT and that's normal! The buffer tank decouples the two loops.
# The card handles this correctly by using each flow sensor for its respective pipe animation.

# Temperature Sensors:
# - CX50 Modbus provides inlet/outlet temps for heat pump
# - Shelly sensors provide supply/return temps at buffer tank
# - Use consistent units (all F or all C) for best visualization

# COP Calculation:
# The card displays COP from sensor.heat_pump_cop which is calculated as:
# COP = Thermal Output (W) / Electrical Input (W)
#
# Target: 4.55 COP at 47°F ambient
# Current: ~2.0-2.5 (being optimized)

# Thermal Power Sensors:
# - sensor.heat_pump_thermal_power_output: Calculated from CX50 flow × ΔT
# - sensor.hvac_thermal_power_used: Calculated from HVAC flow × ΔT (now FIXED!)
#
# After the Celsius fix, these should match within 10-15% (system losses)

# Color Visualization Tips:
# - Hot outlet from HP should show red/orange
# - Return to HP should show blue (cooled by radiant floor)
# - If colors look wrong, adjust min_temp/max_temp range
# - Wider range = more subtle colors, narrower = more dramatic colors
